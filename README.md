## Project Overview:
This Unity project was created as part of Assignment 02 – Part 1.
It includes several interactive scripts demonstrating basic Unity behaviors: oscillation, rotation, and visibility toggling using the new Input System.

## Features:
Oscillator: Simulates a pendulum-like motion using Mathf.Sin. The object swings left/right on an arc, slowing at the ends and speeding up in the middle.

Rotator: Continuously rotates an object around a selected axis. Rotation speed and space (local or world) are editable in the Inspector.

Pulsator (Scaler): Makes a sphere (or any object) “beat” by scaling up and down smoothly over time (frequency and amplitude configurable).

VisibilityToggle: Shows or hides objects with the H key. Can also affect children and colliders. Uses the new Unity Input System.
